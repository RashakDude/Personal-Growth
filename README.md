### :dart: 11 Life Lessons from the books

<ol>

<li> The 80/20 rule
<p> 20% of your customers makes 80% of your profits. <br>
20% of your tasks create 80% of your results. </p>

<li> Have a strong why 
<p> Overcome any "how" by a strong "why". <br>
No matter what path you will take, there will be obstacles that discourage you. <br>
With a strong enough "why", nothing will stand in your way. </p>

<li> Extreme Ownership
<p> Not everything that happens to you is your fault, but it is your responsibility. No one is coming to save you. <br>
Take control of your life by taking extreme ownership of everything that happens to you - the good and the bad. </p>

<li> Deep Work
<p> The standard 8 hour work day is a myth. <br>
2 to 4 hours of ultra-focused work will get you 8 hours or more of output. <br>
Beat your competition and get more done in less using deep work. </p>

<li> Amor Fati
<p> A stoic phrase that translates to "love of fate". <br>
A fancy way of accepting not everything in life is within your control. </p>

<li> Memento Mori
<p> Translates to "remember you will die". <br>
Awareness of your fate will bring clarity and urgency to what is worth doing. <br>
You have a finite amount of time on this planet. Use it wisely. </p>

<li> Essentialism
<p> Most things in life aren't worth your time. <br>
Regain control of your choices by saying "yes" to only what's most essential to you. <br>
Allowing you to put more time on the goals and priorities that matter most. </p>

<li> Antifragility
<p> Life's unexpected curveballs either make you, break you, or don't affect you at all. <br>
Antifragile people from unexpected life events. Like the mythical hydra who grows two heads when you cut one off. <br>
As the saying goes, pressure makes diamonds. </p>

<li> Think in Bets
<p> The best decision making hack of all time. Think about your odds, instead of right vs. wrong. <br>
Win more than you lose by thinking in bets. </p>

<li> Nudges
<p> Our environment influences our decisions, so set it in your favor. <br>
Want to make writing a habit? Make it easy by setting up the desk a day before. <br>
Alter your environment to nudge you in the right direction. </p>

<li> Negative Visualisation
<p> Looking for a hack to prepare for the tough times ahead? <br>
Visualise the obstacles you will face ahead of time and how you will overcome them. <br>
Nothing can catch you off guard if you have already imagined and prepared for it. </p>
