### :dart: 11 Life Lessons from the books

<ol>

<li> The 80/20 rule
<p> 20% of your customers makes 80% of your profits. <br>
20% of your tasks create 80% of your results. </p>

<li> Have a strong why 
<p> Overcome any "how" by a strong "why". <br>
No matter what path you will take, there will be obstacles that discourage you. <br>
With a strong enough "why", nothing will stand in your way. </p>

<li> Extreme Ownership
<p> Not everything that happens to you is your fault, but it is your responsibility. No one is coming to save you. <br>
Take control of your life by taking extreme ownership of everything that happens to you - the good and the bad. </p>

<li> Deep Work
<p> The standard 8 hour work day is a myth. <br>
2 to 4 hours of ultra-focused work will get you 8 hours or more of output. <br>
Beat your competition and get more done in less using deep work. </p>

<li> Amor Fati
<p> A stoic phrase that translates to "love of fate". <br>
A fancy way of accepting not everything in life is within your control. </p>

<li> Memento Mori
<p> Translates to "remember you will die". <br>
Awareness of your fate will bring clarity and urgency to what is worth doing. <br>
You have a finite amount of time on this planet. Use it wisely. </p>

<li> Essentialism
<p> Most things in life aren't worth your time. <br>
Regain control of your choices by saying "yes" to only what's most essential to you. <br>
Allowing you to put more time on the goals and priorities that matter most. </p>

<li> Antifragility
<p> Life's unexpected curveballs either make you, break you, or don't affect you at all. <br>
Antifragile people from unexpected life events. Like the mythical hydra who grows two heads when you cut one off. <br>
As the saying goes, pressure makes diamonds. </p>

<li> Think in Bets
<p> The best decision making hack of all time. Think about your odds, instead of right vs. wrong. <br>
Win more than you lose by thinking in bets. </p>

<li> Nudges
<p> Our environment influences our decisions, so set it in your favor. <br>
Want to make writing a habit? Make it easy by setting up the desk a day before. <br>
Alter your environment to nudge you in the right direction. </p>

<li> Negative Visualisation
<p> Looking for a hack to prepare for the tough times ahead? <br>
Visualise the obstacles you will face ahead of time and how you will overcome them. <br>
Nothing can catch you off guard if you have already imagined and prepared for it. </p>

### :brain: 10 Ideas that will stimulate your thinking

<ol> 
  <li> Agenda Setting Theory
    <p> Mainstream media sets the agenda of public disclosure. The more attention the media gives to certain issues, the more likely the public is to consider them important. <br>
      Don't pay blind attention to what's on the "agenda" and forget what's not being said. </p>
  <li> The Ergodic Switch
    <p> In an ergodic scenario, the average outcome of the group is same as the average outcome of the individual over time. <br>
      We are taught to think that most systems are ergodic. In reality, most human systems are non-ergodic. Don't blindly believe in averages. <p> 
  <li> Convexity
    <p> Convexity payoffs have larger gains than the pains - the potential upside is greater than the downside. <br>
      The majority seek to cap downside by entering conformist professionals, but in doing so cap their upside too. <br>
      Lesson: Incorporate some calculated risks in your plan </p>
  <li> The Map is Not the Territory
    <p> No model is a perfect representation of the reality, but some are still useful. <br>
      The more complex the system or territory, the greater the chance of inconsistencies.  <br>
      You don't truly understand a model or a map, unless you know its limitations. </p>
  <li> Wisdom of the Crowd
    <p> The intelligence of a diverse group is superior to that of any of the individuals within the group. <br>
      When possible, seek multiple diverse and alternative perspectives for better solutions. </p>
  <li> The Paradox of Abundance
    <p> The average quality of information is decreasing over time. But the highest quality stuff gets better and better. <br>
      Abundance is simultaneously bad for the 'median' consumer but good for the 'conscious, discerning' consumer who filters out noise. </p>
  <li> Google Scholar Effect
    <p> Highly cited papers appear in top positions and gain even more citations. <br>
      New papers struggle to appear in the top positions and therefore get less attention, regardless of their contribution to their fields. <p>
  <li> Curse of Knowledge
    <p> Once we know something, we assume everyone else knows about it. <br>
      It's why some experts can't explain their field in simple terms and people don't share knowledge that could benefit others. <br>
      Lesson: There are always people to teach and people to learn from. </p>
  <li> Predictive Coding
    <p> "You experience in some sense, the world that you expect to experience" - Andy Clark <br>
      Our perception replaces the unknown with the expected to help us organise our experience of the world effeciently. </p>
  <li> Locus of control
    <p> Internal: You believe that outcomes are within your control. <br>
      External: You believe that outcomes are beyond your control. <br>
      The more control you believe you have, the less likely you are to conform to the status quo. </p>
</ol>
